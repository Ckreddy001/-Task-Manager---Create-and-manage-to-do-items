# Task Manager

## Project Description

Task Manager is a decentralized task management system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. This application allows users to create, manage, and track their to-do items in a transparent, immutable, and decentralized manner. Each task is stored on-chain, ensuring data persistence and ownership without relying on centralized servers.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize personal productivity management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless, transparent, and user-owned task management system. We aim to provide users with complete control over their data while ensuring task history and completion records are permanently stored and verifiable on the blockchain.

## Key Features

### üéØ Core Functionality
- **Create Tasks**: Users can create new tasks with title and description
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed with timestamp recording
- **Update Tasks**: Modify task details before completion
- **View Tasks**: Retrieve individual task details and user task lists

### üîí Security & Ownership
- **Owner-Only Access**: Only task creators can modify or complete their tasks
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation for task titles and descriptions
- **Secure Modifiers**: Protected functions with proper access controls

### üìä Analytics & Tracking
- **Task Counting**: Track total tasks created by each user
- **Completion Tracking**: Monitor completed vs pending tasks
- **Timestamp Records**: Automatic recording of creation and completion times
- **User Dashboard**: View all tasks associated with a user address

### üé® Smart Contract Features
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient storage patterns and function implementations
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for frontend integration
- **Modular Design**: Clean, maintainable code structure
- **Error Handling**: Descriptive error messages for better user experience

## Technical Specifications

### Smart Contract Details
- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.19
- **License**: MIT
- **Main Functions**:
  - `createTask()`: Create new tasks
  - `completeTask()`: Mark tasks as completed
  - `updateTask()`: Modify existing tasks

### Data Structures
- **Task Struct**: Stores task ID, title, description, completion status, timestamps, and owner
- **Mappings**: Efficient storage for tasks and user-task relationships
- **Arrays**: Dynamic arrays for user task lists

### Events
- `TaskCreated`: Emitted when new tasks are created
- `TaskCompleted`: Emitted when tasks are marked as completed
- `TaskUpdated`: Emitted when task details are modified
